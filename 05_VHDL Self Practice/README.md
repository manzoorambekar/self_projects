# VHDL Self Practice

This repository is a collection of self-practice VHDL projects and modules aimed at improving proficiency in digital design using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). It includes basic to intermediate examples that simulate various digital circuits, ideal for FPGA programming and digital system design learners.

## Tools Used

- **ModelSim / QuestaSim** ‚Äì For simulation and verification
- **Vivado / Quartus** ‚Äì For synthesis and implementation on FPGA boards
- **GHDL + GTKWave** ‚Äì For open-source simulation and waveform visualization

---

## How to Use

1. Open any `.vhd` file in your preferred VHDL simulator or IDE.
2. Run the simulation with the matching testbench file.
3. Observe waveforms or outputs to verify logic.
4. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen understanding.
