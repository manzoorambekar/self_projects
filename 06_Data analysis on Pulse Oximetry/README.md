# Data Analysis on Pulse Oximetry

This project provides tools and scripts for analyzing pulse oximetry data, including signal processing, visualization, and feature extraction. The repository contains MATLAB scripts, sample datasets, and documentation to support research and development in non-invasive blood oxygen monitoring.

## Project Structure

- **Data Source/**: Contains raw pulse oximetry data files from various subjects and conditions.
- **Docs/**: Documentation, analysis reports, and supporting materials.
  - **AC_DC/**: Analysis related to AC/DC component extraction.
  - **Data_Derivative/**: Scripts and results for derivative-based analysis.
  - **Data_Visualisation/**: Visualization outputs and scripts.
  - **Spectrogam_Tests/**: Spectrogram analysis and test images.
- **src/**: MATLAB source code for data processing and analysis.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of pulse oximetry signals.
- Extraction of AC and DC components.
- Visualization of time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics.
- Spectrogram analysis for time-frequency representation.
- Example datasets for testing and validation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `src/` folder in MATLAB.
3. Run the provided scripts (e.g., `Data_visualisation.m`, `Data_Derivative.m`) to analyze sample data from the `Data Source/` folder.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (recommended version R2018b or later)

## Documentation

See `Docs/Brief Description and Analysis on Pulse Oximetry.pdf` for a detailed overview of the analysis methods and results.
