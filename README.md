# Self Projects â€“ Manzoor Ambekar

Welcome to my **Self Projects** repository!  
This is a collection of diverse projects I've worked on out of curiosity, interest, or a desire to explore new areas. While many projects are rooted in embedded systems and C programming, others reflect my learning in different domains such as system programming, scripting, and software tooling.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?

Each folder represents a standalone project or learning module. Topics vary based on what I found interesting at the timeâ€”some are embedded-focused, others are system-level or exploratory in nature.
