# Projects â€“ Manzoor Ambekar

Welcome to my **Projects** repository!  
This is a collection of diverse projects I've worked on out of curiosity, interest, or a desire to explore new areas. While many projects are rooted in embedded systems and C programming, others reflect my learning in different domains such as system programming, scripting, and software tooling.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?

Each folder represents a standalone project or learning module. Topics vary based on what I found interesting at the timeâ€”some are embedded-focused, others are system-level or exploratory in nature.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `01_RoboSantral` | Autonomous guide robot for the museums (Bachelor's Thesis topic) |
| `02_Electronic Safe with IOT` | IoT-enabled electronic safe with remote monitoring and control features |
| `03_SDR Using Adalm-Pluto` | Software Defined Radio projects using Adalm-Pluto, including QAM modulation transceivers |
| `04_BER Optimization for MIMO using CSXC` | Project for the simulation of complex systems to understand Lagrangian Optimization |
| `05_VHDL Self Practice` | Practice programs and exercises to learn VHDL |
| `06_Data analysis on Pulse Oximetry` | Practice programs to learn VHDL |

Feel free to explore any folder for detailed documentation, code, and insights into each project!
