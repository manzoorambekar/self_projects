# RoboSantral, An Autonomous Guiding Robot

It which has been designed and realized in order to guide the visitors through a museum. This robot accompanies guests through the museum and gives presentations on predefined locations. Location data is obtained from RFID tags pasted on particular location.
A RFID reader reads the targets such as faculty buildings, museums etc. These are recognized by the pre-defined tags. A voice playback unit using SD card is used to playback the information of particular location. IR sensors are used for obstacle detection.

## Reflection

The Tour Guide Robot was designed to fulfill this need which has several different components such as Arduino, Raspberry-Pi, LCD screen, sensors, speakers, motion kits… In the design, components were integrated in order to implement a self-navigating, introductive guide robot. Guidance tasks are achieved with the data from surroundings processing on Tour Guide Robot's software

There is a fundamental approach behind every successful mobile robot application. The integration of the different parts of a mobile robot has an extreme importance in design. This robot accompanies guests through the campus and gives presentations on predefined locations. Location data is obtained from GPS sensors. Targets such as faculty buildings, museums etc... are recognized by the image processing of pre-defined tags. As microprocessor and microcontroller, Raspberry Pi and Arduino are used respectively.

The Tour Guide Robot uses the metjjodology of image processing .the initial cost can be high depending on system use.If the computer crashes then images that have not been prinyed will be lost. camera suffers from memory card problems , high cost and battery problem.

Therefore, for avoiding such disadvantages of image processing , which is complex method and time consuming , we have used a RF-ID based system named ROBOSANTRAL.
