# RoboSantral, An Autonomous Guiding Robot

It which has been designed and realized in order to guide the visitors through a museum. This robot accompanies guests through the museum and gives presentations on predefined locations. Location data is obtained from RFID tags pasted on particular location.
A RFID reader reads the targets such as faculty buildings, museums etc. These are recognized by the pre-defined tags. A voice playback unit using SD card is used to playback the information of particular location. IR sensors are used for obstacle detection.

## Reflection

Mobile robots which came as an alternative to the stationary constraints of the industrial robots first had missions such as exploring other planets or inhospitable areas on Earth, collecting geological samples. As the costs of mobile robots come down, the fields of use are extending rapidly, including the daily use of mobile robots.

In this paper an autonomous mobile robot that is designed and developed to greet and guide the visitors of a university campus is presented. Besides halls, theatres, concert areas, libraries and museums, university campuses are preferred locations of artistic exhibitions and cultural activities. This makes university campuses a center of attraction not only for the students but also for the native and international visitors. When the required manpower for introduction and guidance of crowded visitors is considered, a mobile robot with navigation capabilities turns out to be a desirable choice.

The autonomous mobile guide robot RoboSantral was designed to fulfill this need. RoboSantral has several different components such as Microcontrollers, LCD screen, sensors, speakers, DC motor drive controller. In the design, components were integrated in order to implement a self-navigating, introductive guide robot. Guidance tasks are achieved with the data from surroundings processing on RoboSantral‚Äôs software. Following sections of this paper presents information on the design, implementation and the test phases of RoboSantral.

There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.

The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.

The idea of a tour guide robot in a museum environment has already been addressed several times in the past. Within those projects the museum specific part of the story is usually limited to showing around visitors and presenting information to the exhibits or in the sense of a concierge robot to point out interesting exhibitions. For our project of a tour guide robot, the interactive and entertaining presentation of information is one of our main goals. Our project demonstrator is situated in a historical computer science exhibition. From our experience, a lot of users are not particularly interested in vintage computer hardware. Furthermore, one has to argue for such projects about the benefits over a human presenter.
